The Parties irrevocably accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid arbitrage court and hereby further irrevocably agree not to plead or claim in any other court.\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>19. AML Policy.</strong></span> Although GEX is currently unregulated and does not fall within the scope of the AML/CTF obligations, the senior management has implemented systems and procedures that meet the standards set forth by the European Union.
